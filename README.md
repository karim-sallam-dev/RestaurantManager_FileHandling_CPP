# RestaurantManager_FileHandling_CPP

A simple console-based restaurant order management system built using **C++** as a practice project.

## 📌 About the Project

This project was developed to enhance my understanding of essential programming principles using **C++**, with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, file handling, and building interactive console-based applications.


While I'm currently exploring full-stack web development with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), I have already gained solid experience in C++ through building projects and applying concepts like data structures and algorithms.
